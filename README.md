## Research Project: Kernel Stability & Numerical Methods

Advanced numerical experiments exploring kernel behavior, conditioning, and stable differencing—part of a research study on Gaussian Processes and kernel methods.

### **Experiments with Clustered Points and Preconditioning**
- Studies ill-conditioning of kernel matrices when data points cluster.
- Implements and analyzes preconditioning strategies.
- Visualizes conditioning numbers for different configurations.

### **IMQ Kernels: Stable Differencing Using mpmath**
- High-precision numerical experiments using `mpmath`.
- Implements stable differencing formulas for IMQ kernels.
- Demonstrates how small perturbations and spacing affect kernel stability.
- Includes plots and comparisons of naive vs stable formulations.
